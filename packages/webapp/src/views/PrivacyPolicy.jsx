      <h2 className="my-2">9. U.S. Specific Provisions</h2>

      <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the country to require commercial
        websites and online services to post privacy policies. The law's reach
        extends far beyond California to require any person or company in the
        United States (and perhaps the world) that operates a website that
        collects personally identifiable information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website that accurately
        identifies the information being collected and those individuals or
        companies with whom it is being shared - See more at:
        http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
        Under CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
      </p>
      <p>Users may visit our site anonymously.</p>
      <p>
        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
        home page or, at a minimum, on the first page of significance after you
        enter our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy link contains the word "Privacy Policy" and can be
        easily found on the page linked above.
      </p>
      <p>You will be notified of any changes to the Privacy Policy:</p>
      <p>By email</p>
      <p>You can change your personal information:</p>
      <p>By logging into your account</p>
      <p>COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
      <p>
        When it comes to collecting personal information from children under the
        age of 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) gives
        parents control. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. consumer
        protection agency, enforces the COPPA rule, which spells out what
        operators of websites and online services must do to protect the privacy
        and safety of children online.
      </p>
      <p>We do not market specifically to children under the age of 16.</p>
      <p>Fair Information Practices</p>
      <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the basis of privacy law
        in the United States, and the concepts they contain have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        world. Understanding the principles of fair information practices and
        their implementation is critical to compliance with the various privacy
        laws that protect personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        To comply with fair information practices, we will take the following
        actions when a data breach occurs:
      </p>
      <p>We will notify you via email</p>
      <p>
        We also agree to the principle of individual redress, which requires
        that individuals have the right to seek legally enforceable rights
        against data collectors and processors who do not comply with the law.
        This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
        rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
        courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
        non-compliance by data processors.
      </p>
      <p>CAN SPAM Act</p>
      <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that establishes rules for commercial emails,
        sets requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to
        stop sending emails, and imposes strict penalties for violations. We
